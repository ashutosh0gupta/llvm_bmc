# MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl test with 7 c

## Original code
See ./MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl.litmus

## C code
See ./MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl.c
Note that we are cheating a bit by using long data type instead of atomic_int in the file.

## Translated code
See MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl.c.cbmc_out.cpp. This is the output of code-to-code translation with 7 context switches and 1 loop unrolling. 7 is the minimum number of context switches to explore expected behaviours by CBMC.

This file can be generated by the following command:
```python
./llvmbmc --unwind 1 -o ./tmp/ --context-bound 7 -k ./MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl.c
```

## CBMC trace for 7 context switches
See ./MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl.trace.log

This file can be generated by the following command:
```python
./cbmc ./tmp/MP+dmb.sy+[fr-rf]-ctrl.c
```
